load the packages
```{r setup, include=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)

```

Load the csv and shape files
```{r}
#load the csv file and assign na to all null values
#the data set has been renamed as 'homework_dataset' and it's under the directory 'datafolder' 
dataset <- read_csv("datafolder/homework_dataset.csv",na=" ") %>%
   dplyr::rename(index_2010="gii_2010",index_2019="gii_2019")%>%
  select(country,index_2010,index_2019)
shapefile <- st_read("../World_Countries_Generalized/World_Countries_Generalized.shp")

```



```{r}
dataset <- na.omit(dataset)
#remove the NAs in dataset
newdataset <- dataset %>%
  mutate(difference=(index_2019-index_2010))
# create a new column using the index of 2010 subtract from the index of 2019


joined_data <- shapefile %>% 
 
  left_join(., 
            newdataset,
            by = c("COUNTRY"="country"))
# left join the data

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
